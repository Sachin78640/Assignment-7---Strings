Here's a Java implementation that reverses the first k characters for every 2k characters, according to the given requirements:


public class ReverseString {
    public static String reverseString(String s, int k) {
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int n = arr.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2 * k) {
            int left = i;
            int right = Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1);
            
            while (left < right) {
                char temp = arr[left];
                arr[left] = arr[right];
                arr[right] = temp;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return new String(arr);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "abcdefg";
        int k = 2;
        String reversed = reverseString(s, k);
        System.out.println(reversed);
    }
}
Output:
bacdfeg

In the reverseString function, we convert the input string s into a character array for easier manipulation. Then, we iterate over the string with a step of 2k, representing the start index of each segment to be reversed.

Inside the loop, we determine the indices left and right that represent the range of characters to be reversed for the current segment. We use Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1) to handle cases where there are fewer than k characters left in the string.

Next, we reverse the characters within the range [left, right] using a two-pointer technique. After reversing, we move the left pointer to the right and the right pointer to the left until they meet or cross each other.

Finally, we convert the character array back to a string and return the result. In the main function, we demonstrate the usage of the reverseString function with the provided example input, and print the resulting reversed string.
