        String s = "abcde";
        String goal = "cdeab";
        boolean result = canShift(s, goal);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

Output:
true

The canShift function first checks if the lengths of s and goal are equal. If they're not equal, it means no number of shifts can transform s into goal, so we return false immediately.

Next, we concatenate s with itself to create a larger string concatenated. This is done to handle cases where the shift wraps around the original string. For example, if s = "abcde", then concatenated will be "abcdeabcde".

Finally, we check if concatenated contains goal using the contains method. If goal is present in concatenated, it means s can be transformed into goal after some number of shifts, so we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

In the main function, we demonstrate the usage of the canShift function with the provided example input, and print the resulting boolean value.
